                                Specify the number of concurrent consumers to create. Default is 1.

                                Specifying a higher value for this setting will increase the standard level of scheduled

                                consumers which will be scheduled at any given time. This is a static setting; for
                                dynamic scaling, consider specifying the "maxConcurrentConsumers" setting instead.

                                Raising the number of concurrent consumers is recommendable in order to scale the
                                consumption of events. However, note that any ordering guarantees are lost once multiple
                                consumers are registered. In general, stick with 1 consumer for low-volume events.

                                Specify the maximum number of concurrent consumers to create. Default is 1.

                                If this setting is higher than "concurrentConsumers", the listener container will
                                dynamically schedule new consumers at runtime, provided that enough incoming messages
                                are encountered. Once the load goes down again, the number of consumers will be reduced
                                to the standard level ("concurrentConsumers") again.

                                Raising the number of concurrent consumers is recommendable in order to scale the

                                Specify the maximum number of events to process in one task. More concretely, this
                                limits the number of event reception attempts per task, which includes receive
                                iterations that did not actually pick up a event until they hit their timeout (see
                                "receiveTimeout" property).

                                Default is unlimited (-1) in case of a standard TaskExecutor, and 1 in case of a
                                SchedulingTaskExecutor that indicates a preference for short-lived tasks. Specify a
                                number of 10 to 100 messages to balance between extremely long-lived and extremely
                                short-lived tasks here.

                                Long-lived tasks avoid frequent thread context switches through sticking with the same
                                thread all the way through, while short-lived tasks allow thread pools to control the
                                scheduling. Hence, thread pools will usually prefer short-lived tasks.

                                Specify the limit for idle executions of a receive task, not having received any event
                                within its execution. If this limit is reached, the task will shut down and leave
                                receiving to other executing tasks (in case of dynamic scheduling; see the
                                "maxConcurrentConsumers" setting). Default is 1.

                                Within each task execution, a number of event reception attempts (according to the
                                "maxEventsPerTask" setting) will each wait for an incoming event (according to the
                                "receiveTimeout" setting). If all of those receive attempts in a given task return
                                without an event, the task is considered idle with respect to received events. Such a
                                task may still be rescheduled; however, once it reached the specified
                                "idleTaskExecutionLimit", it will shut down (in case of dynamic scaling).

                                Raise this limit if you encounter too frequent scaling up and down. With this limit
                                being higher, an idle consumer will be kept around longer, avoiding the restart of a
                                consumer once a new load of messages comes in. Alternatively, specify a higher
                                "maxMessagePerTask" and/or "receiveTimeout" value, which will also lead to idle
                                consumers being kept around for a longer time (while also increasing the average
                                execution time of each scheduled task).
